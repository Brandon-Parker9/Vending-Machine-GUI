# Vending-Machine-GUI

This GUI was created as a project for our OOP introduction course. The entire project was written from scratch and we had to follow a few simple guidelines. Other than that, we were allowed to code/create what ever we wanted.

This is one of my first experiences creating a GUI especially with Java, so looking back there is definitely room for improvement.
